# NovelAI-Colab
Fully functional Colab based on AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui with the leaked model included

## Instructions
Save and import the `.ipynb` on Google Colab and follow the instructions there

## Contributing
If possible, perhaps there is a better way to get the NovelAI files. I currently have it self hosted but would prefer it somewhere safer than a test server that may crash at any time.
