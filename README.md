## Extra features
- Fixes issue https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/2260 and https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/160
- Uses localtunnel for sharing

## Contributing
If possible, perhaps there is a better way to get the NovelAI files. I currently have it self hosted but would prefer it somewhere safer than a test server that may crash at any time.

## Files
- `NovelAI_Diffusion.ipynb` - For NovelAI (Original)
- SD-NSFW_allowed.ipynb - For Stable Diffusion (By NOP)
